# Arduino-IR-remote
Very simple Infrared Receiver Control with Arduino UNO and ky022 using IRRemote.h latest 2021 library.
It should work with any standard apliance remote control. I am using the one that came in a LAFVIN Arduino Kit on Amazon.
The value contains the code of the key pressed. Edit the if statements so you can control anything.
